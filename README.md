# Self-Push

Like the name suggests, this repository is going to push open itself

at `00:14 UTC` every day, a github action will run to automatically update this repo specifically the log.txt file.
But it seems to work around `05:00 CAT`, Github pro'lly has a lot of traffic around the actually specified time.
